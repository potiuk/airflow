name: fix-security-issue
description: |
  Attempt to fix a security issue tracked in airflow-s/airflow-s by
  implementing the change in a public apache/airflow PR. Runs the
  sync-security-issue skill first to reconcile the issue's state, then
  analyses the discussion to decide whether the issue is easily fixable
  (clear consensus, small scope, known location). If it is, proposes an
  implementation plan, waits for explicit user confirmation, writes the
  change in the user's local apache/airflow clone, runs the local checks
  and tests, opens a PR from the user's fork via `gh pr create --web`,
  and updates the airflow-s tracking issue with the new PR link and any
  relevant labels. Public PR content is checked to make sure it does
  **not** reveal the CVE, the security nature of the change, or any link
  back to airflow-s/airflow-s.
when_to_use: |
  Invoke when a security team member says "try to fix issue NNN", "see
  if you can land a fix for NNN", "draft a PR for NNN", or similar —
  *after* the issue has been triaged and the team has a rough consensus
  on what the fix should look like. Not appropriate for issues that are
  still being assessed, for reports that haven't been classified as
  valid vulnerabilities, or for changes that require private
  code-review in `airflow-s/airflow-s` itself (the private-PR fallback
  in process step 9 of README.md).

# fix-security-issue

This skill automates the "attempt a fix" step of the security handling
process for issues in [`airflow-s/airflow-s`](https://github.com/airflow-s/airflow-s).
It composes with the [`sync-security-issue`](../sync-security-issue/SKILL.md)
skill — it always runs the sync first so that the issue's state is
reconciled with the mail thread and any existing PRs before attempting
any new work.

**Golden rule:** Every state-changing action — writing files in the
local `apache/airflow` clone, committing, pushing to the user's fork,
opening a public PR, editing or commenting on `airflow-s/airflow-s`,
drafting mail on the `security@` thread — is a *proposal* that requires
explicit confirmation from the user before it runs. The fact that the
user invoked the skill is not a blanket "yes". In particular, **nothing
public is pushed without the user explicitly approving the exact PR
title, body and diff first.**

**Confidentiality is paramount.** The resulting PR in `apache/airflow`
is public to the world. It must not reveal the CVE ID, the security
nature of the change, or any link back to `airflow-s/airflow-s`. See
the "Confidentiality of `airflow-s/airflow-s`" section of
[`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md) and process step 8 of
[`README.md`](../../../README.md).

---

## Inputs

Before running the skill, you need:

- **Issue number** in `airflow-s/airflow-s` (required) — e.g. `#216` or
  just `216`.
- **Path to local `apache/airflow` clone** (optional — the skill will
  probe the usual locations if omitted). The clone must have a fork
  remote configured; the user's fork is the only push target the skill
  will accept.

If the user does not supply the issue number, ask for it before doing
anything else.

---

## Prerequisites

This is the skill with the most environmental requirements — the
pre-flight check below is worth running seriously before you
invest 10+ minutes reading, planning, and writing code against a
tracker only to discover you cannot push the branch.

- **`gh` CLI authenticated** with:
  - collaborator access to `airflow-s/airflow-s` (the skill
    updates the tracker after the PR is open);
  - push access to **your personal fork of `apache/airflow`** on
    GitHub. The skill will **not** push to `apache/airflow`
    directly — a fork is required.
- **A clean local clone of `apache/airflow`** reachable from the
  agent's working directory. The path comes from the user's
  [`config/user.md`](../../../config/user.md) →
  `environment.apache_airflow_clone`; if the file or key is missing,
  the skill asks the user interactively and offers to save the
  answer back into `config/user.md` so the next run is silent. The
  skill does **not** guess filesystem layouts — there is no
  hard-coded search path. The clone must:
  - have a remote pointing at your fork;
  - be on a non-dirty `main` (or the appropriate base branch) —
    the skill will create a new branch from that base;
  - have the project's dev toolchain available — for the active
    project see
    [`projects/airflow/fix-workflow.md`](../../../projects/airflow/fix-workflow.md#toolchain)
    (`uv`, Python 3.x, `breeze` when needed) and
    [`apache/airflow/contributing-docs`](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/README.md).
- **Outbound HTTPS to `pypi.org` / `github.com`** for dependency
  resolution and `gh` API calls.

See
[Prerequisites for running the agent skills](../../../README.md#prerequisites-for-running-the-agent-skills)
in `README.md` for the overall setup.

---

## Step 0 — Pre-flight check

Do **all** of these before the Step 1 sync. Any failure is an
immediate stop — do not partial-fix half the environment and
continue.

1. **`gh` authenticated** —
   `gh api repos/airflow-s/airflow-s --jq .name` and
   `gh api repos/apache/airflow --jq .name` both return. A 401/403
   on the first means no airflow-s access; on the second it is a
   quota/auth issue — both require user action, stop.
2. **Fork exists and is pushable** —
   `gh repo view <your-login>/airflow --json name --jq .name`
   returns `airflow`. If there is no fork, tell the user to run
   `gh repo fork apache/airflow --clone=false` and re-invoke.
3. **Local clone is found and clean** — probe the usual locations
   (the input path if supplied, else `~/code/airflow`,
   `~/src/airflow`, `~/airflow`, or a sibling of the current
   working directory) for a directory whose `origin` remote
   points at `apache/airflow`. Then verify `git status
   --porcelain` is empty. Uncommitted work would collide with the
   branch the skill is about to create; stop and ask the user to
   stash / commit / clean first.
4. **Base branch is current** — `git fetch origin` and make sure
   the base (default `main`, or the branch the user specified) is
   a fast-forward of `origin/<base>`. Stale bases produce stale
   PRs.
5. **Toolchain probe** — `uv --version`, `python3 --version`. If
   `breeze` is required for the area of the fix, also
   `breeze --version`. Any missing tool stops the skill;
   installing them mid-run is out of scope.

Only after **every** check is green, proceed to Step 1.

---

## Step 1 — Sync the issue first

Run the [`sync-security-issue`](../sync-security-issue/SKILL.md) skill
on the same issue number and apply any state corrections the user
confirms there. **Do not attempt a fix before the sync has completed**,
because:

- the issue may already have a fix PR linked that only needs to be
  nudged (review request, rebase, backport label), not a new one
  written from scratch;
- the issue may be in a state where a fix is premature — still under
  triage, awaiting reporter input, or waiting on a wider-audience
  discussion per process step 4 of [`README.md`](../../../README.md);
- the issue may already be closed / advisory-published, in which case
  the correct action is an erratum, not a new PR;
- some of the metadata the fix workflow needs (scope label, milestone,
  assignees, fix PR URL) may be stale and will be corrected during the
  sync.

Capture the sync's final state and next-step recommendation — they are
inputs to Step 2.

---

## Step 2 — Assess whether the issue is easily fixable

Read the issue body and the full comment thread — already fetched by
the sync — and classify whether the fix should be attempted right now.

### Easily-fixable signals (all of these should be true or close to
true)

- **Clear consensus on the approach.** There is either an explicit
  "approach 2 for me as well" style vote, or one proposal has been
  discussed and no one has disagreed, or a maintainer has concretely
  said "we should just do X".
- **Known location.** The discussion points to specific file paths,
  function names, or line numbers in `apache/airflow` where the fix
  should land. Bonus: there is an explicit code snippet in the
  discussion showing what the change should look like.
- **Small scope.** The fix touches a handful of files, one component,
  no migrations, no new public API, no new dependencies, no
  configuration changes.
- **No open technical questions.** No "we still need to check if…",
  "waiting for reporter to confirm…", or "we need to agree on the
  response shape" threads left dangling.
- **The security classification is settled.** The team agrees this is
  a valid vulnerability (or valid hardening), not still being argued
  over.

### Hard-to-fix signals (any one of these is a stop condition)

- Multiple competing approaches are still being debated in the
  comments, with no convergence.
- The fix requires architectural changes, new abstractions, or
  cross-team coordination.
- The discussion contains *"I'm not sure this is even a security
  issue"* that has not yet been resolved.
- The fix requires input from the reporter that has not yet been
  provided.
- The fix would need to be coordinated with a non-security change
  that is already in flight (e.g. a refactor that is rewriting the
  affected code).
- The scope is large (many files, migration, API change, breaking
  change) — a public PR would invite questions in review that hint at
  the security nature of the fix, and that has to be handled via the
  private-PR fallback (process step 9).
- The affected component is a third-party provider code path where
  the correct fix belongs in the provider's own repository, not in
  `apache/airflow` main.

### Report the classification

Present the classification to the user explicitly. If **not** easily
fixable, report why, suggest a concrete next step (a question for the
issue comments, a targeted email to the reporter, a short proposal to
send to the security team, a call for wider input, etc.), and **stop
the skill**. Do not skip to implementation just because the user
invoked the fix skill.

If **easily fixable**, extract and write down:

- the file paths that will need to change,
- a one-paragraph description of the intended change (non-security
  language, see Step 4),
- any code snippet from the discussion that captures the fix,
- the set of tests that the change should cover (existing tests to
  update, new tests to add),
- the target branch (`main` almost always; a release branch only if
  the user explicitly says so),
- any backport label that should be applied to the eventual PR, based
  on the milestone on the `airflow-s` issue (the active project's
  backport-label policy and current release branches live in
  [`projects/airflow/fix-workflow.md`](../../../projects/airflow/fix-workflow.md#backport-labels)
  and
  [`projects/airflow/release-trains.md`](../../../projects/airflow/release-trains.md)).

---

## Step 3 — Locate and verify the local `apache/airflow` clone

The skill will never write into `airflow-s/airflow-s` for a code
change; it writes into a local clone of `apache/airflow`. Before
touching any files:

1. Resolve the clone path from the user's
   [`config/user.md`](../../../config/user.md) →
   `environment.apache_airflow_clone` (see
   [`config/README.md`](../../../config/README.md) for the config
   layer explainer). If the file is missing, the key is unset, or
   the stored path does not resolve to a git repo with a remote
   pointing at `apache/airflow` or the user's fork, **ask the user
   for the path interactively** and offer to save their answer back
   into `config/user.md` so the next run is silent. Do **not**
   probe hard-coded paths like `~/code/airflow` — filesystem layouts
   vary per user and a wrong guess masks a misconfigured clone.

2. Check `git remote -v`. Identify which remote is the **user's fork**
   and which is the upstream `apache/airflow`. Per the rule in
   [`apache/airflow/AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/AGENTS.md),
   push only to the user's fork, never to `apache/airflow` directly.
   If the user's `config/user.md` has
   `environment.apache_airflow_fork_remote` set, prefer that remote
   name; otherwise use the first non-`origin` remote that looks like
   a fork. If no fork remote is configured, **stop and ask the user
   to configure one** (`gh repo fork apache/airflow --remote
   --remote-name <name>`); do not auto-create one.

3. Check that the working tree is clean (`git status` shows no
   untracked or modified files the user did not opt in to).
   If it is dirty, stop and ask the user how to proceed.

4. Check that `prek` is installed and hooks are enabled per
   `apache/airflow/AGENTS.md` — `uv tool install prek` and
   `prek install` if not.

5. Fast-forward the base branch to the latest upstream. For a typical
   fix, that is `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git fetch <upstream-remote> main
   git reset --hard <upstream-remote>/main
   ```

   Do not run this destructive command without the user's explicit
   confirmation if `main` is ahead of the upstream for any reason.

---

## Step 4 — Propose the implementation plan (do not touch any code yet)

Present a single, compact plan with the following sections. The plan
is a *proposal*, and **no code is written until the user confirms it
verbatim.**

### 4a. Branch and base

- **Base:** `main` (or the specific release branch if agreed).
- **Branch name:** Use a descriptive, non-security slug. For example:
  - good: `fix-extra-links-xcom-deserialization`
  - good: `tighten-assets-graph-dag-permission-check`
  - **bad** (reveals security / links airflow-s): `cve-2026-40690`,
    `security-fix-218`, `airflow-s-216`.

### 4b. Files that will change

A bullet list of file paths (relative to the repo root), each with a
one-line description of the change. Where the discussion pointed to
specific lines, include them. If the discussion included a code
snippet, reproduce it here so the user can confirm it's what will be
written.

### 4c. Commit message and PR title

The commit message and the PR title must be **neutral bug-fix /
improvement language**. They must not contain any of:

- `CVE-YYYY-NNNNN`
- `CVE`, `vulnerability`, `security fix`, `advisory`
- `airflow-s`, `airflow-s/airflow-s`, `#216`, `airflow-s#216`
- any reporter name tied to a security finding
- the word *"sensitive"* in a way that points at an unmasked-credential
  bug
- wording that would allow a reader to reconstruct the attack from
  the PR alone

Good examples (neutral, accurate):

- *"Fix asset graph view leaking DAGs outside the user's permissions"*
- *"Add `access_key` and `connection_string` to DEFAULT_SENSITIVE_FIELDS"*
- *"Improve xcom value handling in extra links API"*

The PR description must describe the change, not the vulnerability.
It can and should reference the public documentation being changed
and include a test plan, but it must not say *"this fixes a security
issue"* or link to any private tracker.

### 4d. Test plan

List:

- existing tests that the change must continue to pass,
- new tests to be added that exercise the fix (required unless the
  change is a pure rename / typo fix),
- the exact commands the skill will run locally before pushing, taken
  from `apache/airflow/AGENTS.md`:

  - `uv run --project airflow-core pytest path/to/test.py::TestClass::test_method -xvs` (unit test),
  - `prek run --from-ref main --stage pre-commit` (fast static checks),
  - `prek run --from-ref main --stage manual` (slow static checks),
  - and a type-check (`uv run --project <project> --with "apache-airflow-devel-common[mypy]" mypy <path>`) where applicable.

### 4e. Backport label

If the `airflow-s` issue's milestone indicates a release branch that
has not yet been cut (e.g. `3.1.9`, `3.2.1`), note which
`backport-to-vX-Y-test` label the PR should carry so that the fix
lands on the intended patch release. If no backport is needed (the
milestone is the next `main`-branch release), say so explicitly.

### 4f. Newsfragment

Per `apache/airflow/AGENTS.md`, newsfragments are only added for
major or breaking user-visible changes, and usually coordinated
during review. For a security-adjacent bug fix, default to **not**
adding a newsfragment in the initial PR — reviewers will ask for one
if needed. Never add a newsfragment that describes the change as a
security fix, because that reveals the security nature and defeats
the whole point of the private tracking workflow.

### 4g. PR body draft

Write out the exact `--body` the skill will pass to
`gh pr create --web`. Include:

- a brief description of the user-visible change,
- the test plan (markdown checklist),
- the standard Gen-AI disclosure block per
  [`apache/airflow/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst`](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst#gen-ai-assisted-contributions):

  ```
  ##### Was generative AI tooling used to co-author this PR?

  - [X] Yes — Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context)

  Generated-by: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) following the guidelines at
  https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst#gen-ai-assisted-contributions
  ```

Before presenting the body, **grep it for the forbidden terms** listed
in 4c and flag any hit to the user. Do not ship anything that matches.

---

## Step 5 — Confirm the plan with the user

Present the full plan and wait for explicit confirmation. Accept:

- `all` / `yes` — apply the whole plan.
- numbered confirmation — apply only the listed items.
- free-form edits — if the user wants to change the branch name, a
  file, the PR title / body, or the test plan, update the plan and
  re-present it for confirmation.
- `none` / `cancel` — stop. Do not touch any files.

Never assume confirmation. If the user replies ambiguously, ask again.

---

## Step 6 — Implement, check locally, and show the diff

Only after Step 5 confirmation:

1. Create the branch with the agreed name off the freshly pulled
   base.
2. Make the file edits from 4b, using the small-edit tools where
   possible (prefer `Edit` over `Write` unless creating a new file).
3. Run the test and static-check commands from 4d. If any fail, stop
   and report the failure — do not push red code to the fork.
4. Run `git diff main...HEAD` against the upstream base, and present
   the full diff to the user.

**Wait for the user to confirm the diff before the next step.** They
may ask for tweaks; if so, apply them, re-run the checks, and re-show
the diff.

---

## Step 7 — Commit and push to the fork

After the user confirms the diff:

1. Stage only the intentional changes (`git add <paths>` — never
   `git add -A` or `git add .`).
2. Commit with the agreed message from 4c, ending in the
   `Generated-by:` trailer (not `Co-Authored-By:`), per
   [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md).
3. Rebase onto the latest upstream base one more time in case
   something landed while you were working:

   ```bash
   git fetch <upstream-remote> <base-branch>
   git rebase <upstream-remote>/<base-branch>
   ```

4. Push the branch to the **user's fork** — never to
   `apache/airflow` directly, never with `--force` unless the user
   explicitly asked (and then only with `--force-with-lease`):

   ```bash
   git push -u <fork-remote> <branch-name>
   ```

---

## Step 8 — Open the PR on the public apache/airflow repo

Use `gh pr create --web` with the pre-filled title and body from 4c
and 4g. The user reviews the title, body and gen-AI disclosure in the
browser before actually submitting the PR — matching the rule in
[`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md).

```bash
gh pr create --web --repo apache/airflow --base <base-branch> \
  --title "<neutral title>" \
  --body "$(cat /tmp/pr-body-<issue>.md)"
```

If a backport label is needed, apply it via `gh` after the PR is
created:

```bash
gh pr edit <PR-NUMBER> --repo apache/airflow --add-label "backport-to-v3-2-test"
```

This is safe to do immediately after PR creation — the backport bot
only fires on merge, not on label application, so there is no race
with CI. Applying the label early ensures it is not forgotten.

**Grep the PR body one more time for forbidden terms** (`CVE`,
`airflow-s`, `vulnerability`, `security fix`, `advisory`, private
issue number, reporter name tied to a finding) before calling
`gh pr create --web`. If anything matches, abort and tell the user.

After the user submits the PR in the browser, capture the PR URL
(either from the browser or by running
`gh pr view --json url --jq .url`) for Step 9.

---

## Step 9 — Update the airflow-s tracking issue

Now that a public PR exists, update the private tracking issue:

1. **Add a comment** on the private issue announcing the new PR, the
   branch name, and the intended backport (if any). Render the issue
   reference, the PR reference, and any CVE as clickable markdown links
   per the "Linking CVEs" and "Linking `airflow-s/airflow-s` issues and
   PRs" rules in [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md). A comment lives
   inside the private repo so it may freely contain the
   `apache/airflow` PR URL, the branch name, and the CVE reference.

   Before posting, **scrub the comment body for bare-name mentions**
   of project maintainers, release managers, and security-team
   members, and replace them with the corresponding `@`-handle so
   GitHub actually notifies the person. The rule itself lives in
   [`AGENTS.md` — *Mentioning project maintainers and security-team members*](../../../AGENTS.md#mentioning-project-maintainers-and-security-team-members);
   the authoritative list of handles for the active project is in
   [`projects/airflow/release-trains.md`](../../../projects/airflow/release-trains.md).
   The public `apache/airflow` PR description and any follow-up public
   comments must also obey the rule, but under the usual public-surface
   confidentiality constraints (no `CVE-`, `airflow-s`, *"security fix"*,
   etc. alongside the mention).

2. **Update the issue body "PR with the fix" field** if it is empty
   or points to a stale PR. Use `gh issue view --json body`, patch
   only that field, and apply via `gh issue edit --body-file`, as
   in the [`sync-security-issue`](../sync-security-issue/SKILL.md)
   skill.

3. **Maintain milestones and labels** — see the next section.

4. **Status update to the reporter** — if the airflow-s issue has an
   identified external reporter and the reporter has not yet been
   told about the fix PR, delegate to the `sync-security-issue`
   skill's "Status update to the reporter" category by re-running
   that skill with a pointer to the new PR. Do **not** draft the
   reporter email directly in this skill — it is the sync skill's
   responsibility.

### Maintaining milestones and labels on `airflow-s/airflow-s`

The fix skill is responsible for leaving the private issue in a
consistent "fix-proposed, awaiting review" state by the time it
returns. That means both the milestone and the label set must match
the current release plan (see "Release branches currently in flight"
in [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md) for the authoritative default
release target). **Every action in this section is a proposal that
requires explicit user confirmation before it is applied.**

#### 9a. Ensure the target milestone exists

The default milestone for a patch-release fix is whatever
`AGENTS.md` names as the next patch release (currently **`3.2.2`**).
Before assigning, check that the milestone exists:

```bash
gh api 'repos/airflow-s/airflow-s/milestones?state=all&per_page=100' \
  --jq '.[] | select(.title == "<target>") | {number, state}'
```

If the query returns nothing, **propose creating the milestone**:

```bash
gh api repos/airflow-s/airflow-s/milestones \
  -f title='<target>' \
  -f state=open \
  -f description='Airflow <target> release tracking.'
```

The skill must present the `title`, `state` and `description` it
will use and wait for a `yes` before running the create call. Once
created, capture the returned milestone `number` — you will need it
for a closed-milestone fallback later.

If the milestone exists but is **closed** (for example because it
was reopened from history), `gh issue edit --milestone "<title>"`
will fail with `'<title>' not found`. Fall back to the REST API and
reference it by number:

```bash
gh api repos/airflow-s/airflow-s/issues/<N> -X PATCH -F milestone=<milestone-number>
```

#### 9b. Assign the issue to the target milestone

If the issue currently sits on a stale milestone (for example
`3.1.9`, `3.2.1` now that it has been cut, or the legacy `Airflow 3`
placeholder), propose moving it to the current default and apply
with user confirmation:

```bash
gh issue edit <N> --repo airflow-s/airflow-s --milestone '<target>'
# or, for closed milestones, via REST:
gh api repos/airflow-s/airflow-s/issues/<N> -X PATCH -F milestone=<number>
```

Do **not** silently move an issue that is intentionally parked on
an older milestone (e.g. an already-released patch that still needs
an advisory sent). When in doubt, surface the question to the user
instead of moving it.

#### 9c. Ensure the required labels exist

The current label set on `airflow-s/airflow-s` can be listed with:

```bash
gh label list --repo airflow-s/airflow-s --limit 100 \
  --json name,description,color --jq '.[].name'
```

For a post-triage, pre-merge fix, the target label set is:

- **one** scope label: `airflow` | `providers` | `chart`;
- `cve allocated` if a CVE has been allocated;
- `needs triage` **removed** (if still present after triage);
- `pr created` once the public PR is open;
- **not** `pr merged` or `fix released` (those belong to post-merge
  / post-release states, applied by the `sync-security-issue` skill
  on later runs);
- **not** `announced - emails sent` or `announced` (those
  belong to post-advisory states, also applied by the sync skill).

If a label the skill wants to apply does **not** exist on the
repository (for example a typo in a past doc version — the canonical
example is the README historically saying `vendor-advisory` when the
actual label is `announced - emails sent`), stop and report the
mismatch. Do **not** silently create labels without asking — label
names are the shared vocabulary of the security team, and new labels
should be discussed.

If the user confirms creating a label, do it explicitly:

```bash
gh label create '<name>' --repo airflow-s/airflow-s \
  --description '<short description>' \
  --color '<hex>'
```

#### 9d. Apply the label changes

Once the target label set is agreed, apply all add / remove
operations in a single `gh issue edit` call so the change lands as
one audit trail entry:

```bash
gh issue edit <N> --repo airflow-s/airflow-s \
  --add-label 'airflow,cve allocated' \
  --remove-label 'needs triage'
```

#### 9e. Consistency checks before moving on

Before leaving the tracking issue, verify:

- exactly one scope label is set (`airflow` **xor** `providers`
  **xor** `chart`);
- the milestone matches the current default from `AGENTS.md`, or
  the user has explicitly confirmed a different one;
- the issue body "PR with the fix" field points at the newly-opened
  public PR;
- the `cve allocated` label is present if the issue body contains a
  CVE tool link, and absent if it does not;
- `needs triage` is gone.

Surface any remaining inconsistency in the Step 10 recap.

---

## Step 10 — Recap

Print a short recap:

- the public PR URL,
- the branch name (in the user's fork),
- the list of files changed,
- the tests that were run and their results,
- the comment posted on the `airflow-s` issue,
- the backport label that was applied (or a note that none was needed),
- the next step — typically *"wait for review; re-run
  sync-security-issue after the PR merges to transition the issue
  from `pr created` to `pr merged` and update the milestone"*.

## Guardrails

- **No public leakage.** The skill runs a final `grep` for
  `CVE-`, `airflow-s`, `vulnerability`, `security fix`, `advisory`,
  `security@`, the issue number preceded by `airflow-s#`, and any
  reporter name on every piece of text headed for a public surface —
  commit message, PR title, PR body, branch name, newsfragment,
  comments on `apache/airflow`. If any hit, abort and ask the user.
- **Fork only.** Never push to `apache/airflow` directly.
- **No force push** to a shared branch or to `main` on any remote.
  `--force-with-lease` on the user's own feature branch is allowed
  only with explicit approval.
- **Tests must pass.** Do not push a branch with failing unit tests
  or failing pre-commit hooks.
- **Small edits over large.** Prefer `Edit` over `Write`; prefer the
  minimum-size diff that implements the fix; do not "tidy up"
  surrounding code while you're there.
- **No newsfragment for security fixes** unless explicitly approved.
  A security newsfragment broadcasts the security nature of the
  change.
- **Stop on disagreement.** If at any point the local checks, upstream
  CI, or a reviewer flags a problem the skill did not anticipate,
  stop and surface it to the user — do not retry indefinitely.
- **Follow AGENTS.md.** Everything in the top-level
  [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md) of this repo — confidentiality,
  commit trailers, `gh pr create --web`, polite-but-firm tone, CVE
  linking — applies, and takes precedence over anything in this
  skill file if the two ever disagree.
