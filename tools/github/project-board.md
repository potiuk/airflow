# GitHub — project board (Projects V2)

The **project board** is the security team's primary overview surface:
a Projects V2 board where every tracking issue sits in exactly one
`Status` column representing its current lifecycle state. The
`sync-security-issue` skill reads the current column as part of its
state-gather, and reconciles it against the issue's labels + body
state as part of its apply loop.

Board-column mutations go through the GitHub GraphQL API
(`updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue`) — the `gh` CLI does not expose a
flag-based interface for Projects V2.

## What the board is for

- Reads: humans scanning *"who is on what right now"*, agents
  verifying that the tracker's label-derived state matches the board
  column before proposing the next transition.
- Writes: sync-style skills moving the tracker from one column to
  the next whenever a label / body state change warrants it.

## Auto-add workflow filter

The board's built-in **"Auto-add to project"** workflow decides which
newly-opened issues land on the board automatically. The filter
**must gate on the `security issue` label** so that only security
trackers are added, not every issue opened in `tracker_repo`:

```text
is:issue label:"security issue"
```

This pairs with two upstream guarantees that ensure every legitimate
security tracker carries the label:

1. The repo's [issue template](issue-template.md) lists `security
   issue` in its `labels:` frontmatter, so any tracker created via
   *New issue → Airflow Security Issue* gets the label automatically.
2. The `import-security-issue` skill passes `--label 'security issue'`
   on every `gh issue create` it runs.

Manually-opened issues (no template, no skill) will not appear on the
board until a triager applies the label by hand — that is the
intended behaviour, since such issues are usually noise.

**This filter is UI-only.** GitHub's GraphQL API exposes the workflow's
`id` / `name` / `enabled` fields but **not** the filter expression, so
neither `gh` nor a GraphQL mutation can set it. To change it:

1. Open `<project_board_url>/workflows` (for Airflow:
   <https://github.com/orgs/airflow-s/projects/2/workflows>).
2. Click **Auto-add to project**.
3. Edit the **Filter** field to the expression above.
4. Save.

If the workflow is ever disabled or its filter is widened, freshly-
created trackers will land in the *orphan-issue* path (see below) and
need an explicit `addProjectV2ItemById` call before any column
mutation can succeed.

## Per-project configuration

Three values are project-specific and live in the active project's
manifest:

1. **Project node ID** (`project_board_node_id`) — the opaque
   `PVT_*` ID that identifies the board. Fetch once; stable unless
   the board is deleted and recreated.
2. **Status field node ID** (`status_field_node_id`) — the opaque
   `PVTSSF_*` ID of the `Status` single-select field. Stable unless
   the field is deleted and recreated.
3. **Column → option-ID mapping** (`status_column_option_ids`) — each
   column of the `Status` field has an opaque `ProjectV2SingleSelectFieldOption`
   ID. **These regenerate whenever the column list is edited** —
   renaming a column, adding a new one, or re-ordering them all
   invalidate every cached ID at once. Re-run the introspection
   query (below) after any column edit.

For the currently active project (Airflow), all three values are
declared in
[`../../projects/airflow/project.md`](../../projects/airflow/project.md#github-project-board).

## Introspection — find the itemId and current column

Run this when the sync skill's Step 1a reads the tracker state. It
returns the `itemId` (needed for the write mutation later) and the
current `Status` column name:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query($n: Int!) {
  repository(owner: "<tracker-owner>", name: "<tracker-name>") {
    issue(number: $n) {
      projectItems(first: 5) {
        nodes {
          id
          project { number }
          fieldValues(first: 20) {
            nodes {
              ... on ProjectV2ItemFieldSingleSelectValue {
                field { ... on ProjectV2SingleSelectField { name } }
                name
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' -F n=<N> \
  --jq '.data.repository.issue.projectItems.nodes[]
        | select(.project.number == <project-number>)
        | {itemId: .id, status: (.fieldValues.nodes[] | select(.name != null)).name}'
```

Substitute the `<tracker-owner>` / `<tracker-name>` / `<project-number>`
values from the project manifest. The query returns one object per
matching project item; if the issue is not on the board yet, the
result is empty and the skill falls back to the *orphan-issue* path
(see below).

## Introspection — re-fetch the option IDs

Run this when the column-option IDs stop working (a write mutation
starts returning `not found`):

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query($pid: ID!) {
  node(id: $pid) {
    ... on ProjectV2 {
      field(name: "Status") {
        ... on ProjectV2SingleSelectField {
          id
          options { id name }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' -F pid=<project-board-node-id> \
  --jq '.data.node.field | {statusFieldId: .id, options: .options}'
```

Update the project manifest's option-ID table with the returned
values. The GraphQL `updateProjectV2Field` mutation replaces the whole
option list rather than editing it in place, so a single column rename
or add regenerates **every** option ID at once.

## Write — move a tracker to a different column

Once the `itemId` is known (from the Step 1a read), move the tracker
by calling `updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue` with the target column's
option ID:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  mutation($pid: ID!, $iid: ID!, $fid: ID!, $oid: String!) {
    updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue(input: {
      projectId: $pid
      itemId: $iid
      fieldId: $fid
      value: { singleSelectOptionId: $oid }
    }) { projectV2Item { id } }
  }' \
  -F pid=<project-board-node-id> \
  -F iid=<itemId from the introspection query> \
  -F fid=<status-field-node-id> \
  -F oid=<option-id of the target column>
```

## Orphan-issue path

If the introspection query returns an empty result, the tracker does
not yet have a project item — typically a freshly-created tracker
that the board's automation has not picked up. Add it to the board
first via `addProjectV2ItemById` using the issue's node ID, then call
`updateProjectV2ItemFieldValue` on the returned item ID:

```bash
# Step 1: get the issue's node ID.
gh api graphql -f query='
query($n: Int!) {
  repository(owner: "<tracker-owner>", name: "<tracker-name>") {
    issue(number: $n) { id }
  }
}' -F n=<N> --jq '.data.repository.issue.id'

# Step 2: add the issue to the project board.
gh api graphql -f query='
  mutation($pid: ID!, $nid: ID!) {
    addProjectV2ItemById(input: { projectId: $pid, contentId: $nid })
      { item { id } }
  }' \
  -F pid=<project-board-node-id> \
  -F nid=<issue-node-id-from-step-1>

# Step 3: move the newly-added item to the target column (see the write recipe above).
```

## When the board is a no-op

Not every GitHub-backed project runs a Projects V2 board. A project
that lists its trackers via plain issue lists or milestones can leave
the board-related fields in its manifest empty; sync-style skills
should treat missing board config as *"no board reconciliation to do"*
and skip the board-column proposal without failing the sync.
