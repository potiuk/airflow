Airflow 2.11.1 will drop support for Python 3.9 and require Python 3.10 or later.

The main point behind upgrading Python version to 3.10 is that
Python 3.9 is officially end-of-life and many of the dependencies
had already stopped releasing even security fixes for 3.9.

Since the upcoming 2.11.1 version is mainly a security-focused
release, we decided to drop support for Python 3.9 in order to
be able to upgrade all related dependencies to latest security
patch versions. There are absolutely minimal changes in behaviour
between Python 3.9 and 3.10 and we have not experienced virtually
any problems because of this - other than dependency issues, so
it should be very minimal overhead for anyone to upgrade to
Python 3.10 even if they used Python 3.9.
