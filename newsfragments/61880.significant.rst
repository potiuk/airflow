Retrieving historical log templates is disabled in Airflow 2.11.1

When you change the log template in Airflow 2.11.1, the historical log templates are not retrieved.
This means that if you have existing logs that were generated using a different log template,
they will not be accessible using the new log template.

This change is due to potential security issues that could arise from retrieving historical log templates,
which allow Dag Authors to execute arbitrary code in webserver when retrieving logs.
By disabling the retrieval of historical log templates, Airflow 2.11.1 aims to enhance the security of the
system and prevent potential vulnerabilities in case the potential of executing arbitrary code in webserver
is important for Airflow deployment.

Users who need to access historical logs generated with a different log template will need to manually
update their log files to match the naming of their historical log files with the latest log template
configured in Airflow configuration, or they can set the "core.use_historical_filename_templates"
configuration option to True to enable the retrieval of historical log templates, if they are fine with
the Dag Authors being able to execute arbitrary code in webserver when retrieving logs.
