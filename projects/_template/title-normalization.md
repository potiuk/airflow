# TODO: `<Project Name>` — CVE title normalisation

The CVE record's `title` field is scoped to the product by the CNA
container (e.g. `Apache <Project>`, `Apache <Project> <Component>
Provider`), so the title pasted into the CVE-tool allocation form
should be the **bare description** — no project prefix, no
redundant version suffix, no reporter-added tag like
`[ Security Report ]`.

The [`allocate-cve`](../../.claude/skills/allocate-cve/SKILL.md)
skill reads this file for the exact strip cascade to apply to the
tracker title before pasting it into the allocation form.

**If this project's titles are already normalised** (reporters
don't prepend `<Project>:` or add bracketed tags), you can leave
this file with a note to that effect and the skill will skip the
stripping step. Otherwise, list the regex cascade below.

## Strip cascade

TODO: one rule per bullet, applied in order. Typical patterns:

1. Leading bracketed tags — e.g. `^[ \t]*\[ ?Security (Report|Issue|Vulnerability|Bug) ?\][ \t:|\-–—]*`
2. Leading plain tags — `^[ \t]*Security (Report|Issue|Vulnerability|Bug)[ \t:|\-–—]+`
3. Leading `<Project Name>` (optional version, optional separator) — TODO
4. Leading bare product name (optional version) — TODO
5. Re-apply 1 and 2 — after stripping a version prefix the title
   often reveals a nested `Security Issue |` tag.
6. Trailing `in <Project Name>` — TODO
7. Trailing bare version parens — TODO
8. Trailing GHSA ID paren — `[ \t]*\(GHSA-[\w-]+\)\.?[ \t]*$`
9. Trailing *"split from #NNN"* paren — `[ \t]*\([^)]*split from #\d+[^)]*\)\.?[ \t]*$`
10. Trailing trivia — strip trailing whitespace, trailing `.`,
    collapse internal whitespace.
11. Capitalise — upper-case the first letter; leave the rest alone
    so acronyms stay intact.

## Implementation recipe

TODO: keep the transform inline in the skill, do not create a
separate Python project. See
[`../airflow/title-normalization.md`](../airflow/title-normalization.md#implementation-recipe)
for a worked example (Airflow's cascade).

## Sanity check

Show the stripped title and the original title side by side in the
allocate-cve proposal so the user can spot any over-stripping
before pasting into the CVE tool. If the strip collapses the title
to fewer than 3 words, surface that as a warning and propose a
manual override — over-stripping is worse than leaving one
redundant word in.
